# Explanation

The site we have to *recreate* was AirBnb search page. The interface was the following :

![AirBnb interface](https://ibb.co/cRL2yp)

The main part of the devellopement was about recreating the responsive interface with 3 phases:

 - Desktop : 3 columns layout with filters, list of flats and map. A toggle button allow us to get a fullscreen map view.
 -  Tablet/Low-Rez PC : 2 columns layout with filter and a list of flats. A toggle button allow us to get a view map in exchange of the list.
 - Mobile Phone/Extra Low rez : We only display one column with the list of flats. Still a button allow us to change the view to get a map. On top of the page there is a row displaying filters

The last view may be updated, by adding a button to pop the filters panel rather than displaying it as a single row.
